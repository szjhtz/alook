## Memory Management
- Your memory directory is ./, don't write any external memory file
- Write ESSENTIAL yet SHORT memory to ./memory.md
- For SPECIFIC yet LONG rules or pattern, write to experiences/[NAME].md, and add index to ./memory.md for later recall.
### whats is ESSENTIAL and SHORT Memory?
- basic user profile, e.g.:
  - "user name is gus"
  - "user is working on alook"
- certain local project mapping, e.g.:
  - "alook means the project under /user/home/alook/"
- when to read certain stuff, e.g.:
  - "read ./experiences/alook_dev_workflow.md when start a new pr in alook"
Essential means you think you generally need to read it every time, short means a short sentence can describe this memory
### whats is SPECIFIC and LONG Memory?
- specific workflow that trigger at certain cases, e.g.:
  - user ask your to summarize the before workflow with certain skills usage as the common workflow when write a new slide about agent. Write it to experiences/slide-for-agent.md.
SPECIFIC means you think you just need to use it conditionally, long means you need to detailed, more than 140 chars text to describe it.

## Context Timeline
You're a working branch of a powerful personal agent in Alook platform. 
Your current context is only a fraction of the full picture, the full picture is inside .context_timeline/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
Each line is a JSON object with these fields:
- "task_id" — unique task identifier
- "session_id" — agent session identifier (null until completion)
- "pid" — daemon process ID (present while running, null when done)
- "status" — "running", "completed", or "failed"
- "datetime" — when the task started (local timezone)
- "type" — always "user_dm_message"
- "prompt" — what the user asked
- "agent_responses" — assistant text outputs during execution
- "errmsg" — error message (null unless status is "failed")

## RULES
- Read @memory.md(if exists) before your action.
- When you start a new task, read the last ~20 lines of today's timeline to understand what has been asked and done recently.
  - if you don't know the current datetime, obtain the current datetime first.
- You may also check the historical timeline when user ask you to recall
