 * Owns the TanStack QueryClient for the community subtree.
 *
 * The client is held in `useState(() => createQueryClient())` so React
 * strict-mode double-invoke in dev doesn't discard queries between mounts and
 * so each SSR request gets its own instance rather than sharing a
 * module-scoped singleton across users. Coexists with `<CommunityProvider>`
 * during the God-context migration — later steps move state into TanStack
 * Query and Zustand, then delete the old provider.
