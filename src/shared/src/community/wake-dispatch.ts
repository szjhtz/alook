/**
 * Thin wake-dispatch seam. Lives in `src/shared` (not `src/web`) because

 * need it, and the consumer has no `@opennextjs/cloudflare` / Next.js
 * context — this module does a plain `Fetcher.fetch`, nothing
 * CF-Workers-Next.js-specific.
 *
 * `env.WS_DO_WORKER` is a service binding to the `alook-ws-do` worker's HTTP
 * surface (never a raw DO namespace — `src/web`/`src/wake-worker` cannot
 * fetch a DO stub directly). This function POSTs an already-fully-built
 * `HostCommand` to that worker's `/community-machine/by-id/<machineId>/forward-agent-wake`
 * route and normalizes the response to a boolean — it never inspects,
 * validates, or constructs any part of `command`, and it never exposes the
 * DO-naming mechanics (no public `getMachineDoName` here or anywhere else).
 *
 * Error contract (load-bearing for the queue consumer's retry semantics):
 * - `{ sent: true }` — at least one live doName's DO forwarded the command
 *   to an authenticated daemon WebSocket.
 * - `{ sent: false }` — the ws-do route responded 200 with `{ sent: 0 }`:
 *   no active credential for this machine, or a live credential but no open
 *   WS (daemon offline). This is a known-permanent state for this attempt —
 *   the consumer must `ack()`, not `retry()`. Daemon reconnect warmup
 *   recovers on its own.
 * - throws — the ws-do route (or the service-binding fetch itself) returned
 *   non-2xx, or the fetch itself threw (network error/timeout). This is
 *   transient — the consumer must `retry()`. Never swallowed into
 *   `{ sent: false }`, or a real outage would look identical to "daemon is
 *   just offline" and stop retrying.
